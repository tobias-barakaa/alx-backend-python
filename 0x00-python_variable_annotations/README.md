## Variable Annotations in Python
Welcome to this guide on Variable Annotations in Python! This document aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of this valuable feature, including its purpose, syntax, usage, and limitations.

# What are Variable Annotations?
Variable annotations are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to specify the expected type of a variable. This is often referred to as "type hinting". While Python remains a dynamically typed language, annotations provide several benefits:

Improved code readability: By explicitly stating the expected type of a variable, you make your code easier to understand, both for yourself and others reading it.
Static type checking: Static type checkers like mypy can utilize annotations to identify potential type errors before you run your code, improving your development workflow.
Documentation and introspection: Annotations can serve as a form of documentation within your code, and tools can utilize them for introspection purposes.
Syntax
Variable annotations are placed after the variable name, separated by a colon and followed by the expected type. Here's the basic syntax:

variable_name: type

## There are several ways to express types in annotations:

Built-in types: You can use standard built-in types like int, str, bool, etc.
User-defined types: You can use user-defined class or type names.
Collections: You can use collections like List[int] or Dict[str, bool].
Optional types: You can specify optional types using Union[int, None].
Here are some examples:

name: str
age: int
scores: List[float]
data: Optional[Dict[str, any]]


##Usage
Variable annotations can be used in various contexts:

Variable assignment: You can annotate a variable when assigning it a value.
Function arguments: You can annotate function arguments to specify their expected types.
Function return values: You can annotate the return value of a function to specify its type.
Here are some examples

def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Greets the user by name.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

friends: List[str] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

for friend in friends:
    print(greet(friend))


## Limitations
It's important to remember that variable annotations are primarily a documentation and static analysis tool. They do not affect the actual behavior of your program at runtime. Additionally, not all types can be expressed through annotations.

Here are some limitations to consider:

Annotations are optional and have no impact on runtime behavior.
Not all types can be easily expressed with annotations.
Annotations rely on third-party tools like mypy for static type checking.
